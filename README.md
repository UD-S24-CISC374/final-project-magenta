In the game there will be checkpoints placed within the platformer levels (similar to mario) that act as respawn/progress checkpoints. To unlock these checkpoints, the player must enter a terminal. Inside this terminal there will be three options; a minigame, a problem/learning objective and hints/tips. These hints and tips will be obtained by discovering them in various levels, interacting with NPCs or completing the Among Us style minigames.

# Basic Instructions

To play the game go to [Game Link]https://ud-s24-cisc374.github.io/final-project-magenta/ or the github environment deployemnt linked in the repository.
- If neither of those options work you will have to clone the reposity somewhere with node.js installed and run `npm install` and then `npm run start`.
