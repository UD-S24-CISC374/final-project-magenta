## Elevator Pitch

In the game there will be checkpoints placed within the platformer levels (similar to mario) that act as respawn/progress checkpoints. To unlock these checkpoints, the player must enter a terminal. Inside this terminal there will be three options; a minigame, a problem/learning objective and hints/tips. These hints and tips will be obtained by discovering them in various levels, interacting with NPCs or completing the Among Us style minigames.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Basic Platformer Movement Mechanics
- Git terminal
	- Button’s to input commands initially
	- Typing to insert commands at later levels.
- Among Us Style Mini Games. Drag matches together. Flick switches by clicking.
- Collect coins
- Spike respawn
- Enemy interaction, projectiles, jump on to damage.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

* Git knowledge
    *Interacting with a git repo 
    *Using the console
    *Learning commands
    *Solving merge conflicts

## Target Audiences

* Beginner programmers 
* Freshman in college or in AP programming courses (beyond 8th grade)

## Target Contexts

* The most likely use for this game is in an informal setting. A professor might recommend it as an external resource to get used to the git commands and using github without having the stress of an assignment.
* This game would not be suitable for a formal in class setting due to its use of audio and the time it might take to learn the content.

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- Git Commands: By the end of instruction students will be able to identify the proper situations to use git commands and execute them.
- GitHub Structure: By the end of instruction students will be able to explain how github repositories are structured and where the code is held.
- *Short Name*: *Formal Learning Objective #3*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #1*
- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #2*

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*

*If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- The game will be adaptable to the learning needs of the player
- The game will have a heavy narrative/set and setting that will not only drive the plot, but also the players interest and engagement
- our approach to designing a platformer game will include ideas from a variety of other platformer titles such as difficulty through movement, time constraints, enemy types, etc…

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

Players will interact with the game in a solo setting as the game is intended to be played single player. There will be 3 distinct game modes with possible variation added in the future. These modes include the platformer mode, learning/terminal mode and minigame mode. The game will be played primarily using a mouse and keyboard with players using the keyboard to control player movement and their mouse to navigate through the UI elements of the game.

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- Main Menu: The player, when starting the game, will be greeted with a main menu giving them an option to play the game where they left off (continue), level select, options and help/tutorial
- Narrative: Inbetween levels and 
- *etc.*

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Primary Objective #1*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #1*: Platformer (player movement, obstacles, levels, etc…)
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #2*: Terminal (learning mechanic, typing, buttons, question, etc)
- *Core Gameplay Mechanic #3*: Tips/optional help (logs, npc, minigame)

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure to make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*

## Graphical

## Audio


*Game region/phase/time are ways of designating a particularly important place in the game.*

- Music List (Ambient sound)
  - *Game region/phase/time*: *Example 1*, *Example 2*
  - *Game region/phase/time*: *Example 3*, *Example 4*
  
*Game Interactions are things that trigger SFX, like character movement, hitting a spiky enemy, collecting a coin.*
